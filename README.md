# GamingRoomSoftwareDesign
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted to make a multiplatform web application based on their current android app. Draw it or lose it is the title of their game and they wanted it to have seperate team names with multiple game instances.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well in describing the multiple different routes that the Gaming Room can approach their desired web application. I should have been more specific about the requirements of the software itself though.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I enjoyed how it gave us a clear route of what we should do when solving the different requirements from the Gaming Room.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick my development requirements to modify. I would make it more personal to the application itself rather than listing the multiple routes the Gaming Room could have taken.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs by listing what they are asking and then needing to expand on the needs to fit other requirements of how web applications should function, such as needing it to be RESTful. It is a style of programming and we need to model our stucture of code around it to fit the needs accordingly.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it by needing the requirements, then I wanted to know what the users would like out of the application. Then I would design the software to make it secure, fast, flexible and secure so that users feel safe and happy to use the application. Reducing lag and increasing the interactions between users and the server.
